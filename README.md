# Revised_Projects
Cleaned up projects for easier presentation.

This repository will now also hold newer practice webpages while they are being made. 

Project List:
-

Fil-a_mimic - Incomplete. Attempting to recreate the chick-fil-a website. It has a bit of interesting text and image animation throughout the website that I would like to learn. Currently has no javascript and needs more styling code.

Tourist_page - Mostly complete. Currently has a bug in regards to navigation tabs. In mobile mode, nav menu will not close.

Home_improvement_page - Mostly complete. Unsure if I'll finish this one as it was my first attempt at injecting Javascript into a static page from scratch. If I were to do this again I probably would have approached things differently. Mouse-over text for images flick over while inside of the div. Right nav is misplaced. Needs a cache to improve image load time.
