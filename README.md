# Revised_Projects
Cleaned up projects for easier presentation.

This repository will now also hold newer practice webpages while they are being made. 

Project List:
-

Fil-a_mimic - Incomplete. Attempting to recreate the chick-fil-a website. It has a bit of interesting text and image animation throughout the website that I would like to learn. Currently has no javascript and needs more styling code.

Tourist_page - Mostly complete. Currently has a bug in regards to navigation tabs. In mobile mode, nav menu will not close and in Desktop mode, nav panel will not stay open after mousing from the links and into the open panel - it will flicker open and closed instead.

Home_improvement_page - Mostly complete. Unsure if I'll finish this one as it was my first attempt at injecting Javascript into a static page from scratch. If I were to do this again I probably would have approached things differently. Mouse-over text for images flick over while inside of the div. Right nav is misplaced. Needs a cache to improve image load time.
