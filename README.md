# Revised_Projects
Cleaned up projects for easier presentation.

This repository will now also hold newer practice webpages while they are being made. 

Project List:
-

Fil-a_mimic - Incomplete. Attempting to recreate the chick-fil-a website. It has a bit of interesting text and image animation throughout the website that I would like to learn. Currently has no javascript and needs more styling code.

Tourist_page - Complete! Made this to show that I could do a minimalistic site with some animated functionality.

Home_improvement_page - Now complete. This was my first attempt at adding javascript to a page so if I were to do it again, I would have approuched a few things differently If I were to do this again. Also would have made a cache for the larger images to improve load time.
